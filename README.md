# The Problem
There are only a few radio streaming websites that are decent. A lot suffer from being terrible design or lacking features, some even having a pop up when you play a radio station.

# The Goal
To create an open-source radio streaming website that has real time comments for radio stations (similar to Twitch.tv) with ratings, sorting with a layout similar to imgur.com.
